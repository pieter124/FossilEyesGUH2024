## Fossil-Eyes

A fossil image classification social media web platform that aims to 'gamify' fossil discovery and raise awareness for fossil preservation. An idea that has the potential to create beneficial real-world value to palaeontology whilst appealing to younger audiences.

Main technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, OpenAI API.
It uses a trained model (by us) to classify different type of fossils.


need to create a .env file with a OPEN_AI='api key goes here' 

then do pip -r install requirements.txt to install all the dependencies

then do python app.py to run it

then go onto localhost whatever it says in the terminal :)
